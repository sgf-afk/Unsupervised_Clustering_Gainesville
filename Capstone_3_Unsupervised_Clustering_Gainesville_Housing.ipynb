However, the average days on market is the fastest and they have the (on average) second highest average acreage at .5 acres. Other than that they don't have any particularly distinguishing characteristics. Count of 5288\n",

These areas either see homes constructed on vacant lots or renovated. They have the second highest average price per square foot and heated / cooled square feet. They also have the second longest average time on market, which is likely reflective of their pricing. They also have about an average of 40% new constructions. Count of 1052\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1 = New Construction. On average 93% of homes in this cluster are new constructions, with the remaining being less than 10yrs old. These homes have the lowest average amount of acreage, which tells me they are being built likely in planned developments or in urban cores. They all have construction foundations of slab frames, which is likely due to new coding standards and all have concrete siding. Count of 14 & consistent elements of construction likely means they belong to the same development.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* 2 = The luxury. These houses have the second lowest price per square foot, however due to the average square feet they are the most expensive on average. They also have the highest amount of average acres which reflects larger lots typically held by the wealthy. This class is the only one with no new constructions, which means these larger luxury homes are selling (at a low rate) and aren't the target for new developments. \n",
